    <p align="left"><strong>Dear colleagues, friends, and fellow EOS/ESD  enthusiasts, </strong><br />
    On behalf of  EOS/ESD Association, Inc. and the 2017 Symposium Steering Committee, I would  like to personally welcome you to the 39th annual EOS/ESD Symposium. We are  returning to the beautiful Tucson,   AZ area, where this year&rsquo;s event  will be held at the Westin La Paloma Resort. With its rolling mountains and  miles of cactus, I encourage you to dive into the hot topics of this year&rsquo;s  EOS/ESD presentations, discussions, and exhibitions, and at the same time, take  some time off to enjoy the natural beauty!</p>
    <p align="left"> Continuing its  long tradition, the 2017 EOS/ESD Symposium will address the latest research on  EOS and ESD in the rapidly changing world of electronics. To overcome the  ever-changing challenges from the sensibility of advanced technologies,  progress has to be made in the form of creative ESD design, innovative,  comprehensive, and predictive verification of the control standards and  methods. The 2017 EOS/ESD Symposium addresses these matters and more with  tutorials, workshops, technical sessions, invited talks, and through the  products and services presented in the industry exhibits.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Technical  Program:</strong> For the first time, our technical program, the heart  of the symposium, has introduced two parallel tracks to accommodate your  diverse interests: the <em>On-Chip ESD Design track,</em> and the <em>EOS/ESD in  Manufacturing</em> track. The newly introduced Manufacturing track has adapted a  dynamic format to include discussion group sessions and hands-on sessions to  foster active involvement, while the On-Chip ESD Design track continues to  present the newest technical findings and innovative designs from the industry  and academia.</p>
    <p align="left">      The main  technical program includes 49 outstanding presentations, addressing latest  innovations in the area of EOS and ESD. These will be presented Tuesday through  Thursday in 14 sessions covering hot topics in the areas of <em>manufacturing,  advanced CMOS, RF/high voltage,  system level ESD, ESD case studies, on-chip ESD physics, EOS/ESD EDA tools, and  ESD testing.</em> This year&rsquo;s technical program again features two  year-in-review presentations: on Wednesday,<em>The Birth and the Life of an ESDA Standard</em>, and on  Thursday, <em>Transmission Line Pulse (TLP) Testing for ESD</em>.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Workshops:</strong> The eight symposium workshops taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon  offer an interactive forum for sharing experiences, exchanging knowledge, and  jointly searching for and defining possible solutions. All workshops are  centered on relevant and timely technical topics; each workshop allows  participants the opportunity to learn about different perspectives from other  colleagues in the field and allow the discussion of occasionally controversial  topics in an informal environment. The popular world caf√© style workshop will  return this year again, with a topic on ESD and EMI co-design for both IC and  PCB designers.</p>
    <p align="left">      With this many  carefully selected options happening in Tucson  it provides an experience both impressive and rewarding, for each member travelling  from all around the world. The symposium is a truly international event and I  welcome you to this exciting forum to enjoy all the technical achievements from  your peers, and continue to form the special life-long bond with people,  instruments, and the word of EOS/ESD!</p>
    <p align="left">Sincerely, </p>
